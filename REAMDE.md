# Reddit Image Downloader

Reddit image downloader is a gem for [ruby](http://ruby-lang.org/) which lets you download images from a particular subreddit. 

## Why I made this?

First, I was really bored. For future people who will use this, I made this piece of software during the pandemic of COVID-19. 

The second reason, is that I need a big dataset of food pictures from `r/pizza` or `r/hotdogs`. I also need to have a big repository of memes, so I may use this script on `r/metalmemes` or `r/dankmemes` as well. Just saying though!
